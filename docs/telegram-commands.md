# Telegram commands, buttons & deep links

Beyond plain-text chat, Aeon's Telegram integration supports slash commands,
inline buttons, a `/` autocomplete menu, deep links, and stateless follow-up
questions. Everything works on **both** delivery paths:

- the default **5-minute poller** (`getUpdates` in `.github/workflows/messages.yml`), and
- **instant mode** (~1s) via the Cloudflare Worker in [`apps/webhook/`](../apps/webhook/).

The shared router **[`scripts/telegram-route.sh`](../scripts/telegram-route.sh)** is the
single source of truth for turning an inbound update into an action — no LLM in the
loop for commands, buttons, or replies.

> Prereq: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are set. Aeon is already scoped to
> that single chat, so only you can command the bot.

## 1. Slash commands & the `/` menu

Push your enabled skills to Telegram as slash commands so the `/` autocomplete
menu populates and the message-field menu button points at it:

1. Actions tab → **Setup Telegram Commands** → **Run workflow**
   (`.github/workflows/setup-commands.yml`).
2. It also re-runs automatically on any push to `aeon.yml`, so the menu never drifts.

Command names can only use `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` — so a skill dir `deep-research`
becomes `/deep_research`. The router inverts `_`→`-` when it dispatches.

- `/skillname [args]` dispatches the skill instantly (no Claude call). `args` become
  the skill's `var`, e.g. `/article quantum computing`.
- Reserved: `/start`, `/help`, `/settings`.
- Plain-English messages still fall through to Claude, exactly as before.

Telegram caps the list at 100 commands; the setup workflow truncates + warns beyond that.

## 2. Buttons on notifications

`./notify` (the canonical `scripts/notify.sh`) takes `--buttons`, a JSON array of
rows. `callback_data` has a hard **64-byte** limit — use the compact
`action:skill:arg1:arg2` scheme:

```bash
./notify "BTC dropped 12% in 1h" --buttons '[[
  {"text":"Snooze 24h","callback_data":"snooze:token-movers:BTC:86400"},
  {"text":"Mute BTC","callback_data":"mute:token-movers:BTC"}
]]'
```

Recognised callback actions: `run`, `snooze`, `mute`, `save`, `dismiss`. A `url`
button opens a link and skips the callback loop entirely:

```bash
./notify "PR #482 needs a look" --buttons '[[
  {"text":"Re-run","callback_data":"run:pr-review:482"},
  {"text":"Open PR","url":"https://github.com/you/repo/pull/482"}
]]'
```

### Making snooze & mute real

Button taps append to `memory/mutes.log` (`skill:arg`) and `memory/snoozes.log`
(`skill:arg:until_epoch`). To honour them, a skill passes **`--mute-key`** when it
alerts — `notify` then suppresses the send if the key is muted or snoozed into the
future. No per-skill logic needed:

```bash
./notify "BTC dropped 12% in 1h" \
  --mute-key "token-movers:BTC" \
  --buttons '[[{"text":"Snooze 24h","callback_data":"snooze:token-movers:BTC:86400"},
               {"text":"Mute BTC","callback_data":"mute:token-movers:BTC"}]]'
```

`skills/token-movers/SKILL.md` is the reference implementation.

## 3. Menu button

`setMyCommands` (step 1) already populates the menu button next to the message
field. The setup workflow also calls `setChatMenuButton({type:"commands"})`
explicitly. (Swap in a Mini App later by changing that payload.)

## 4. Deep links

`t.me/<yourbot>?start=<payload>` sends `/start <payload>`. The router reads the
payload as `<skill>__<arg>` (double underscore separates skill from arg; charset is
`A-Za-z0-9_-`, max 64):

- `…?start=digest` → runs `/digest` with defaults
- `…?start=article__quantum` → runs `/article` with `var=quantum`
- `…?start=token-movers__daily` → runs `/token-movers` with `var=daily`

Drop `url` buttons pointing at `t.me/<bot>?start=…` into any notification for
tap-to-run shortcuts.

## 5. Follow-up questions (stateless force-reply)

A skill asks a question with `--force-reply` and a `--context "skill::intent"`
marker; Telegram makes the user's next message a reply carrying that marker back, so
no state file is needed:

```bash
./notify "Which repo?" \
  --force-reply \
  --placeholder "owner/repo" \
  --context "github-monitor::add-repo"
```

The visible text is `[github-monitor::add-repo] Which repo?`. When you reply
`owner/repo`, the router dispatches `github-monitor` with `var=add-repo:owner/repo`.
The skill parses `var` as `intent:value`.

## Operational notes

- **Offset.** The poller now requests `allowed_updates=["message","callback_query"]`
  and advances the offset past both, so button presses don't reprocess every tick.
- **Command drift.** `setMyCommands` shows whatever you last pushed. The setup
  workflow re-runs on any `aeon.yml` push; or trigger it by hand after toggling skills.
- **Callback data length.** 64 bytes is hard. Keep args short (tickers, PR numbers,
  ISO/second durations); if you need more, store the payload in a small file and put a
  short reference key in `callback_data`.
- **Instant mode.** After editing `apps/webhook/src/worker.js`, **redeploy the
  Worker** to pick up command/button/reply routing (`npx wrangler deploy`).
- **Non-owner messages.** The Worker replies "This bot is private." to strangers in
  private chats (keeps the bot's reply rate high) and never acts on them.

## Testing on a scratch bot

Create a second bot via @BotFather, point a private test fork's `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
at it, then: run **Setup Telegram Commands** → `/` menu populates → `/article`
dispatches with no Claude call → tap a button → a row lands in
`memory/snoozes.log`/`mutes.log` → open a `?start=` deep link → reply to a
force-reply prompt and confirm the input reaches the skill. Ship to the live fork
once all pass.
