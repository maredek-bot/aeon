> **${var}** — selects the mode and scope:
> - **empty** → **Mode A (Reply Drafting):** auto-discover reply-worthy tweets across your areas of interest (from recent logs + memory) and draft two reply options for each.
> - **`@handle` / numeric X list ID / topic** → **Mode A (Reply Drafting)** scoped to that handle, list, or topic.
> - **`from-logs`** (or **`--from-logs`**, optionally followed by an `@handle` or project name to narrow the scan) → **Mode B (From-Logs Engagement):** scan recent logs for flagged engagement opportunities and turn them into copy-paste-ready responses.

## Preamble (both modes)

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for context on active projects and open engagement follow-ups.

Then read `memory/logs/` — the window depends on the mode:
- **Mode A:** the last 2 days of `memory/logs/` for recent `list-digest`, `tweet-roundup`, and prior `reply-maker` outputs (used as a candidate pool and for reply de-duplication).
- **Mode B:** the last 7 days of `memory/logs/` for engagement opportunities flagged by other skills (`project-pulse`, `refresh-x`, `reply-maker`, `channel-recap`) or noted in MEMORY.md "Known Follow-ups".

**Parse `${var}` to pick the branch** (trim whitespace, compare case-insensitively):
- If `${var}` is `from-logs` or `--from-logs` — optionally followed by a whitespace-separated `@handle` or project name — run **Mode B (From-Logs Engagement)**. Treat any trailing token as an optional filter that narrows the opportunity scan to that handle/project.
- Otherwise run **Mode A (Reply Drafting)**, treating `${var}` as the scope: empty, `@handle`, numeric X list ID, or a topic string.

## Voice

If soul files exist (`soul/SOUL.md`, `soul/STYLE.md`, `soul/examples/`), read them and **mirror that voice in every reply**. Match sentence length, vocabulary choices, punctuation habits, and the kinds of things the operator would never say.

If no soul files exist (or the bodies are empty placeholders), write replies that are:
- Direct and substantive — no fluff, no sycophancy
- Under 280 characters each (X replies; DMs and GitHub comments may run longer — see Mode B)
- Opinionated but grounded in specifics
- The kind of reply that adds to the conversation, not noise

Either way, when responding to someone who cosigned/mentioned/attributed the operator (Mode B): **acknowledge without groveling** — no "thanks so much for the kind words!", just the actual response.

# Mode A — Reply Drafting

Generate **two reply options** for **5 reply-worthy tweets** from tracked X accounts, a list, or a topic.

### A1. Gather candidate tweets

Goal: assemble **10–15 candidates** posted in the **last 6 hours** (the high-leverage reply window — the algorithm rewards early replies, and the OP is still likely to engage back). **Recency fallback:** if the 6h window yields fewer than 3 candidates after the skip gate, widen to **12h** and retry before failing the run.

For every candidate, capture: `@handle`, full tweet text, tweet URL, `posted_at` (ISO), engagement counts (likes, replies, retweets if available), and a one-line **why-this-tweet** note.

**Path A — pre-fetched cache (preferred).** The workflow pre-fetches Grok x_search results to `.xai-cache/reply-maker.json` (via `scripts/prefetch-xai.sh`, which has full env access and runs outside the Claude sandbox). Read it first:

```bash
jq -r '.output[] | select(.type == "message") | .content[] | select(.type == "output_text") | .text' .xai-cache/reply-maker.json
```

If parsing yields candidates, use them. The prefetch script already shapes the request based on `${var}` (numeric list ID, `@handle`, or topic) — see "Strategy depends on `${var}`" below for the contract it implements.

**Path B — direct curl:** Skipped. The sandbox blocks env-var-authenticated curl; do not attempt at runtime.

Strategy depends on `${var}`:

**If `${var}` looks like an X list ID** (numeric):
```bash
TO_DATE=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
FROM_DATE=$(date -u -d "6 hours ago" +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-6H +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
LIST_ID="${var}"

curl -s -X POST "https://api.x.ai/v1/responses" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-4-1-fast",
    "input": [{"role": "user", "content": "Look at X list https://x.com/i/lists/'"$LIST_ID"'. Return the 12 most reply-worthy original posts (not retweets, not replies) by members of this list between '"$FROM_DATE"' and '"$TO_DATE"'. Reply-worthy = has a take, claim, question, or framing worth engaging — NOT pure self-promo, breaking news without analysis, or threads already past 500 replies. For each: @handle, full tweet text, tweet URL, posted_at ISO timestamp, like/reply/retweet counts."}],
    "tools": [{"type": "x_search", "from_date": "'"$FROM_DATE"'", "to_date": "'"$TO_DATE"'"}]
  }'
```

**If `${var}` looks like a `@handle`**: same call, scoped to that handle's recent original posts.

**If `${var}` is a topic** (or empty): same call with `${var}` (or top 2–3 topics from `memory/MEMORY.md`) as the search query. When empty, also pull tweet candidates surfaced in the last 2 days of `tweet-roundup` and `list-digest` logs as a backup pool.

**Fallback chain** (use in order until you have ≥3 candidates):
1. Pre-fetched XAI cache at `.xai-cache/reply-maker.json` (Path A above)
2. Recent `list-digest` + `tweet-roundup` outputs in `memory/logs/` — already have URLs and handles
3. WebSearch for very recent posts on memory topics (filter: posted within last 6h, original post not reply)

The memory logs are the most reliable source since they're already fetched — prefer them over retrying a blocked API.

### A2. Filter and select 5 tweets

Apply the **skip gate** first. **Discard** any candidate that is:
- Pure self-promo (launching a product, "buy my course", subscribe links)
- Breaking-news repost without an angle of its own
- A thread already past ~500 replies (your reply will not be seen)
- Older than 6 hours (reply window has closed; don't waste a reply slot)
- A handle/URL already replied to in the last 7 days of reply-maker logs (no duplicates)

From the survivors, **rank by leverage** = `recency × take-strength × room-to-add`:
- **Recency**: minutes-ago > hours-ago. Tweets <60min old are top priority.
- **Take-strength**: a clear claim/question/framing you can either reinforce with evidence or challenge with a flipped premise.
- **Room-to-add**: not already swarmed; thread isn't full of stronger replies; you have actual context to contribute.
- Bias toward authors whose audience overlaps your interests (from `memory/MEMORY.md`) — replies on those accounts get seen by people who care about the same things.

Pick the **top 5**. If fewer than 5 survive the gate, output what you have and add `REPLY_MAKER_DEGRADED` to the notification subject line.

### A3. Generate two replies per tweet

For each of the 5 selected tweets, draft **two reply options** with distinct angles:

**Option A — "Evidence add"**
- Builds on their point with a **specific** datum, named project, named person, concrete number, link, or counterexample they didn't include
- Tone: collaborative, substantive, calmly confident
- Must contain at least one named entity, number, or specific reference — vague "great insight, here's another angle" is banned

**Option B — "Frame challenge"**
- States the premise you're pushing back on **explicitly** (one short clause), then offers the contrarian angle, flipped framing, or sharper read
- Tone: direct, opinionated, not contrarian-for-its-own-sake
- Must contain the actual disagreement, not a hedge — vague "interesting, but have you considered..." is banned

#### Hard reply rules (apply to both A and B)

- **≤ 280 characters** including any handle prefix
- **No sycophancy** — see the `## Banned sycophancy phrases` section below. Any draft containing a banned phrase must be rewritten.
- **No hedging stacks** — "It could be argued that…", "Just my two cents but…", "Maybe I'm wrong but…" — pick a position
- **Specifics, not gestures** — names, projects, numbers, links. If you can't cite one, don't write the reply
- **Stand alone** — readers may not see the original tweet; reply must make sense on its own
- **Match soul voice** if soul files are populated

#### Self-edit pass (do this for every reply before finalizing)

For each draft reply, score 1–5 on each:
- **Specific**: cites a name/number/project/claim?
- **Standalone**: makes sense without reading the parent?
- **Non-sycophantic**: passes the banned-phrase list?
- **Voice-matched**: sounds like the soul files (or neutral-direct if no soul)?

If any score is < 4, **rewrite that reply once** before moving on. If the rewrite still scores < 4, drop that tweet from the list and pull the next-ranked candidate from step A2.

### A4. Notify

Send via `./notify` with this format (link first so the operator can open the source quickly):

```
*Reply Maker — ${today}*

*1.* https://x.com/handle/status/123  (@handle, 42m ago, 18💬)
> [first ~80 chars of tweet]…
why: [one-line reason this is reply-worthy]
A: [evidence-add reply]
B: [frame-challenge reply]

*2.* …
… (5 total, or fewer with REPLY_MAKER_DEGRADED if skip gate trimmed below 5)

source-status: xai=ok|fail|skip, memory=N, websearch=ok|fail|skip
```

If zero candidates survive the skip gate from any source, send a single `REPLY_MAKER_EMPTY — [one-line reason]` notification and stop.

### A5. Log

Append to `memory/logs/${today}.md` under the shared `### reply-maker` heading (see **Log** below), using the **Mode A** template.

---

# Mode B — From-Logs Engagement

Turn flagged engagement opportunities from recent logs into ready-to-post replies — read the last 7 days of logs, draft specific responses, send as copy-paste-ready output. **This mode makes no outbound API calls and ignores the `.xai-cache/reply-maker.json` prefetch** — it works purely from local `memory/` files.

**Projects-of-interest list:** if `memory/topics/projects-of-interest.md` exists, treat the project names listed there as the things to watch for mentions, cosigns, attributions, and fork moments. If the file is missing or empty, fall back to any project names that appear in recent logs or in MEMORY.md. If a filter token was passed (`from-logs @handle` or `from-logs <project>`), narrow the scan to opportunities involving that handle/project.

### B1. Collect unactioned engagement opportunities

Read `memory/logs/` for the last 7 days. Look for:
- Log entries flagging engagement opps (e.g. "Engagement opps: N flagged" with N > 0) — extract the named handles/accounts
- Any person who cosigned, mentioned, or attributed one of the operator's projects-of-interest
- GitHub attribution or fork moments not yet acknowledged
- Entries in MEMORY.md "Known Follow-ups" explicitly flagging engagement opps
- Cosigns or mentions surfaced in `refresh-x`, `reply-maker`, or `channel-recap` runs

Build a list: `{ person/account, context, what_they_did, link_if_known, days_ago }`

### B2. Filter and prioritize

Apply these rules:
- Drop any opp older than 14 days — window is likely closed
- De-dupe: skip opps where recent logs already show "replied to @X" or "acknowledged" for that handle
- Rank by: recency (fresher first) × leverage (high-follower or influential account first)
- Cap at 5 opportunities

### B3. Draft ready-to-post responses

For each opportunity:
- **Type**: X reply / X DM / GitHub comment / X post
- **Target**: @handle or URL
- **Draft text**: exact text, ready to copy-paste
- Keep under 280 chars for X replies; longer is fine for DMs or GitHub comments
- Voice: if `soul/SOUL.md` and `soul/STYLE.md` are populated, match that voice; otherwise use a clear, direct, neutral tone. Either way: acknowledge without groveling, no "thanks so much for the kind words!" — just the actual response.

### B4. Check for staleness

If any opportunity is 5+ days old, prepend `aging` to that entry in the output.

### B5. Skip if empty

If after filtering there are zero unactioned opps, log `ENGAGEMENT_ACT_SKIP: no unactioned opps` (under the `### reply-maker` heading) and exit **without sending a notification**.

### B6. Write output to a temp file, then send via `./notify -f`

```
*Reply Maker (from-logs) — ${today}*

*1. @handle* (N days ago) — [one-line summary of what they did]
link: [URL or "no link found"]
type: [X reply / X post / DM / GitHub comment]
draft: "[ready-to-post text]"

*2. @handle* ...

[if any opps are 5+ days old:]
some opps aging — act or drop
```

Write this to `/tmp/reply-maker-from-logs.md` then run `./notify -f /tmp/reply-maker-from-logs.md`.

### B7. Log

Append to `memory/logs/${today}.md` under the shared `### reply-maker` heading (see **Log** below), using the **Mode B** template.

---

## Banned sycophancy phrases

Edit this list as tastes change — any draft reply (either mode) containing one of these (openings or closings) must be rewritten:

- Openings: "Great point", "Love this", "100%", "This 👆", "Couldn't agree more", "So well said", "💯"
- Closings: "Curious to hear your thoughts!" (engagement-hook noise)

## Log

Append one entry to `memory/logs/${today}.md` under a single `### reply-maker` heading, with a `**Mode:**` discriminator line naming which branch ran.

**Mode A (reply drafting):**
```
### reply-maker
- **Mode:** A (reply drafting)
- **Var:** ${var:-<empty>}
- **Candidates collected:** N
- **Survived skip gate:** N
- **Replies generated:** N×2
- **Handles:** @h1, @h2, …
- **Source status:** xai=ok|fail|skip, memory=N, websearch=ok|fail|skip
- **Notification:** sent | degraded | empty
- **Tweet URLs:** [list, for future-day dedup]
```
The `Tweet URLs` line is what tomorrow's run reads to avoid duplicate replies — keep it consistent.

**Mode B (from-logs engagement):**
```
### reply-maker
- **Mode:** B (from-logs engagement)
- **Opps found:** N unactioned (scanned last 7 days of logs)
- **Drafted:** N responses
- **Handles:** @handle1, @handle2, …
- **Notification sent:** yes
- ENGAGEMENT_ACT_OK
```
If skipped: `ENGAGEMENT_ACT_SKIP: <reason>` (still under `### reply-maker`).

## Sandbox note

- **Mode A:** the sandbox blocks outbound curl with `$XAI_API_KEY` in headers — always read the pre-fetched `.xai-cache/reply-maker.json` (populated by `scripts/prefetch-xai.sh`) or fall through to the memory/WebSearch fallback chain. Do not attempt direct curl to `api.x.ai` at runtime. Use **WebFetch** for any non-auth URL fetches.
- **Mode B:** reads only local `memory/` files. No outbound network calls needed — no curl, no API. `./notify -f` handles delivery reliably even when the sandbox blocks curl (it writes to `.pending-notify/` as a fallback).

## Environment Variables Required

- `XAI_API_KEY` — X.AI API key for Grok x_search (**Mode A only, optional** — falls back to WebSearch + memory logs). **Mode B requires no environment variables** and uses only built-in memory files and `./notify`.
