> **${var}** — Mode selector.
> - `` (empty) → **discover + settle**: rank open bounties, notify a shortlist, and queue finalize for any prior submissions ready to claim. Never queues a new submission — zero new spend. *[default]*
> - `hunt` / `hunt:<jobId>` → discover + settle, then pick the best-fit bounty (or the given `<jobId>`), write the report, and queue one on-chain submission for post-run execution.
> - `dry-run` / `dry-run:<jobId>` → same as `hunt` but the queued request is validation-only: the postprocess script calls the API's `/submit/dry-run` and sends **no transactions**.

## Goal

Earn ETH from [Verdikta](https://bounties.verdikta.org) bounties on Base: open bounties carry an escrowed ETH reward and a public rubric; two independent AI models score each submission against the rubric, and a submission at or above the bounty's threshold wins the escrow. This skill does the judgment work — choosing bounties worth attempting and writing reports that score well — while all authed API calls and transaction signing happen outside the sandbox in `scripts/prefetch-verdikta.sh` (before the run) and `scripts/postprocess-verdikta.sh` (after the run).

## Config

| Name | Kind | Default | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| `VERDIKTA_API_KEY` | secret | required | Bot API key (`X-Bot-API-Key`) from `POST https://bounties.verdikta.org/api/bots/register` |
| `VERDIKTA_WALLET_KEY` | secret | — | Private key of a **dedicated** Base hot wallet. Only needed to submit (`hunt`); discover/settle-only and `dry-run` work without it |
| `VERDIKTA_MAX_SPEND_ETH` | repo var | `0.0005` | **Hard client-side cap** on the ETH value of any single transaction the postprocess script will sign, regardless of what the API returns |
| `VERDIKTA_MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_DAY` | repo var | `5` | Daily cap on new submissions (tracked in `memory/state/verdikta-hunter.json`) |
| `VERDIKTA_RPC_URL` | repo var | `https://mainnet.base.org` | Base JSON-RPC endpoint |

### Fund safety — read before enabling

This skill can spend real ETH. The safety envelope, enforced by `scripts/postprocess-verdikta.sh` (not by the model, and not by the remote API):

- **Dedicated wallet only.** Fund a fresh wallet with a small working balance (~0.005 ETH covers gas plus several oracle prepays) and use its key as `VERDIKTA_WALLET_KEY`. Never reuse a wallet that holds anything you can't lose.
- **Hard spend cap.** The oracle prepay (`ethMaxBudget`) comes from the API response, so the script treats it as untrusted: any transaction whose value exceeds `VERDIKTA_MAX_SPEND_ETH` is refused and logged, never signed. The real-world worst-case prepay is ~0.00024 ETH, so the 0.0005 default has headroom without meaningful blast radius. The prepay is escrow, not a fee — the unspent portion is refunded at finalize.
- **Pinned destination.** Transactions are only signed if `to` equals the known BountyEscrow contract `0x2Ae271f5E86bee449a36B943414b7C1a7b39772D` and `chainId` is 8453 (Base). A compromised API response cannot redirect funds elsewhere.
- **Rate limits.** At most one new submission per run, at most `VERDIKTA_MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_DAY` per UTC day, and a balance preflight before every transaction.
- **Deferred execution.** The skill itself only writes request files under `.pending-verdikta/`; if the run errors, the workflow drops the queue and nothing is sent. Start with `dry-run` until you trust the loop.

## Steps

### 0. Parse `${var}` and load context

- Parse the mode: empty → `MODE=discover`; `hunt[:<jobId>]` → `MODE=hunt`; `dry-run[:<jobId>]` → `MODE=hunt` with `DRY_RUN=true`. A trailing `<jobId>` pins the target bounty.
- Read `memory/MEMORY.md` and the last ~3 days of `memory/logs/` (don't re-report signals already sent).
- Read `memory/state/verdikta-hunter.json` if present — it tracks prior submissions (`jobId`, `submissionId`, tx hashes, status, spend) and the daily submission count. Bootstrap mentally with `{"submissions": {}, "daily": {}}` if absent; the postprocess script owns writes to this file.
- Read the prefetched cache: `.verdikta-cache/bounties.json` (open bounties), `.verdikta-cache/rubric-<jobId>.json` (per-bounty rubrics), `.verdikta-cache/submissions-<jobId>.json` (status of bounties we've submitted to). If `.verdikta-cache/` is missing or empty, `VERDIKTA_API_KEY` isn't configured or the prefetch failed — notify `VERDIKTA_HUNTER_ERROR — no cache; check VERDIKTA_API_KEY and prefetch logs`, log, and stop.

### 1. Settle prior submissions (every mode)

For each tracked submission in state, check its current status in `.verdikta-cache/submissions-<jobId>.json`:

- `ACCEPTED_PENDING_CLAIM` or `REJECTED_PENDING_FINALIZATION` → queue a finalize: write `.pending-verdikta/finalize-<jobId>-<subId>.json` containing `{"action": "finalize", "jobId": <n>, "submissionId": <n>}`. Finalize is **mandatory even after a pass** — payment is not automatic, and it's what refunds the unspent oracle prepay after a fail.
- `PENDING_EVALUATION` for more than ~30 minutes (compare state's `submittedAt` to now) → the oracle may be stuck; note it in the report and log. Timeout recovery is intentionally not automated — flag it for the operator with the manual command: `POST /api/jobs/<jobId>/submissions/<subId>/timeout`.
- `APPROVED` (paid) or `REJECTED` (settled) since last run → include the outcome in the notification: score vs threshold, and the payout tx if won.

### 2. Discover and rank open bounties

From `.verdikta-cache/bounties.json`, drop bounties that are: already submitted to by our wallet (in state), past or within ~24h of their `submissionDeadline`, targeted at another hunter (`targetHunter` set and not us), or in a creator-approval window flow (`creatorAssessmentWindowSize > 0`) — windowed bounties are out of scope for v1.

Score the rest on: reward (`payoutWei`) vs. effort implied by the rubric, threshold attainability (lower threshold = easier), competition (`submissions` count), and fit with `STRATEGY.md` priorities and our actual capabilities — **skip bounties requiring work we can't genuinely deliver** (e.g. deliverables needing binary assets, human accounts, or off-repo actions). For each surviving candidate read `.verdikta-cache/rubric-<jobId>.json`: `must: true` criteria are binary gates (fail one = score 0); weighted criteria sum to 1.0.

- `MODE=discover`: notify the top 3–5 as a shortlist (jobId, reward in ETH, threshold, submissions count, one-line rubric summary, deadline), log, and stop. If nothing is worth attempting and nothing settled, stay silent — no empty reports.
- `MODE=hunt`: pick the single best candidate (or the pinned `<jobId>` — but still refuse it if it fails the drop-filters above, and say why). If the daily count in state already meets `VERDIKTA_MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_DAY`, fall back to discover behaviour and note the cap in the notification.

### 3. Write the report

Write the deliverable to `.pending-verdikta/files/<jobId>/report.md` (plus extra files alongside it only if the rubric explicitly demands separate deliverables).

- Address **every** rubric criterion, in rubric order, under explicit headings — the AI jurors score criterion-by-criterion. Treat `must: true` criteria as pass/fail gates and satisfy them beyond doubt.
- Embed all evidence inline in markdown: fenced code blocks for data/commands, full URLs for sources, tx hashes where relevant. Verifiable beats voluminous.
- **Never** produce archives (`.zip`/`.tar`/`.gz`/`.rar`) — the oracle drops them as binary and the models see nothing. Prefer markdown; each uploaded file is forwarded to the jurors individually.
- No placeholders, no "TODO", no fabricated claims — an unverified claim that fails a must-pass gate burns the prepay and the reputation.

### 4. Queue the submission

Write `.pending-verdikta/submit-<jobId>.json`:

```json
{
  "action": "submit",
  "jobId": 97,
  "files": ["report.md"],
  "addendum": "",
  "alpha": 200,
  "maxOracleFee": "0.00002",
  "estimatedBaseCost": "0.00001",
  "maxFeeBasedScaling": 3,
  "dryRun": false
}
```

- `files` are names under `.pending-verdikta/files/<jobId>/`.
- `alpha` 200 favours quality over timeliness (range 0–1000; lower = quality-weighted).
- Keep the fee parameters at these defaults — they bound the oracle prepay by construction; raising them raises `ethMaxBudget`.
- Set `"dryRun": true` when `DRY_RUN` — the postprocess script then only calls `/submit/dry-run` (file readability + rubric shape validation, no gas, no transactions).

The postprocess script executes this after the run: upload → `prepareSubmission` tx (value 0) → confirm → cap-check → `startPreparedSubmission` tx (value = `ethMaxBudget`), then records tx hashes, `submissionId`, and spend into `memory/state/verdikta-hunter.json` and appends a `### verdikta-hunter (postprocess)` entry to today's log. **This run cannot see those results** — the next run reports them (step 1).

### 5. Notify

One `./notify -f` message per run with real signal, following soul/ voice if present. Write the message body to `.verdikta-cache/notify.md` (gitignored and regenerated each run — the harness can't `rm`, so scratch files anywhere else end up auto-committed):

- Settlements first: won (score, payout), lost (score vs threshold, one-line diagnosis from `.verdikta-cache/` evaluation data if available), finalizes queued.
- Then the action taken: shortlist (discover), or "queued submission to #<jobId> (<reward> ETH, threshold <t>%) — pending postprocess" (hunt), or dry-run verdict.
- Severity: `success` for a win, `warn` for a stuck/failed submission or refused cap, `info` otherwise.
- Nothing settled and nothing worth attempting → no notification.

### 6. Log

Append to `memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```
### verdikta-hunter
- Mode: discover | hunt | dry-run
- Open bounties: N (M viable after filters)
- Settled: #97/0 finalize queued | #95/1 WON 0.002 ETH | none
- Queued: submit-97 (0.0015 ETH reward, threshold 80) | none
- Skipped: #98 (deadline <24h), #99 (windowed) — one line, only when relevant
- Notification sent: yes/no
```

## Key gotchas

1. **Always finalize.** Without `finalizeSubmission` the oracle prepay stays escrowed forever — even a winning submission isn't paid until finalize.
2. **`ethMaxBudget` is wei and comes from the API** (`/submit/bundle/complete` → `parsed.ethMaxBudget`). Never hand-decode the `SubmissionPrepared` event with a partial ABI — the budget is the *last* field after a dynamic string, and a truncated ABI reads the string-offset word (96) instead.
3. **must-pass criteria are binary.** `must: true` always has weight 0; failing any one scores the whole submission 0.
4. **Archives are invisible.** `.zip` and friends are dropped by the oracle pipeline; submit individual readable files.
5. **Two-model jury.** Independent AI models score and their weighted results are combined — write for a careful, literal reader, not for keyword-matching.
6. **The confirm call matters.** `POST /api/jobs/:id/submissions/confirm` (between prepare and start) registers the submission for backend tracking; the postprocess script does it — if you ever drive the flow manually, don't skip it.
7. **API statuses lag chain state** by a sync cycle. `GET /api/jobs/:id/onchain-status` is the ground truth when they disagree.

## Sandbox note

The GitHub Actions sandbox blocks secret-bearing outbound calls from the skill itself, so this skill never talks to `bounties.verdikta.org` or signs anything directly:

- **Pre-fetch:** `scripts/prefetch-verdikta.sh` runs before the skill with full env access and caches open bounties, rubrics, and tracked-submission statuses into `.verdikta-cache/`.
- **Post-process:** the skill queues requests in `.pending-verdikta/`; `scripts/postprocess-verdikta.sh` runs after a **successful** run and performs the authed uploads plus the cap-checked signing/broadcast. A failed run drops the queue.
- Public reads that need no auth (e.g. spot-checking a bounty page) may use WebFetch, which bypasses the sandbox. Don't use curl for them.

## Exit codes

- `VERDIKTA_HUNTER_OK` — ran clean (shortlist, queue written, or silent no-op)
- `VERDIKTA_HUNTER_DRY_RUN` — dry-run queued, no transactions will be sent
- `VERDIKTA_HUNTER_CAPPED` — daily submission cap reached; fell back to discover
- `VERDIKTA_HUNTER_ERROR` — missing cache/key or malformed state; notified
