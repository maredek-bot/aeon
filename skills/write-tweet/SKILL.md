description: Multi-format tweet studio — standalone drafts (10 across 5 size tiers), a 5–10 tweet thread, or 10 remixes of past tweets, selected via ${var}
var: ""

requires: [XAI_API_KEY?]
---
> **${var}** — `[format] [argument]`. Pick one of three formats, then pass its argument. Empty ⇒ **drafts** (standalone tweet drafts). `thread …` ⇒ a multi-tweet **thread**. `remix …` ⇒ **remix** of your past tweets. See Selector below.

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for context on recent articles, digests, topics being tracked, and the operator's tracked handles/token. Each branch then reads its own `memory/logs/` window (drafts: 3 days, thread: 7 days, remix: 14 days) — see the branch.

## Selector

Parse `${var}` once, before doing anything else:

1. Trim whitespace. Take the **first token** (everything up to the first space **or** the first `:`), lowercased.
2. If that token is one of `drafts`, `thread`, `remix` → that's the **format**. The **argument** is the remainder of `${var}` after stripping the keyword and one optional following `:` and surrounding whitespace.
3. Otherwise → format is **drafts** and the argument is the **entire** `${var}` (backward-compatible with the legacy `var = topic/URL` behaviour).

| `${var}` | Format | Argument | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| `` (empty) | drafts | — | Auto-select the most tweetable insight from today's logs |
| `prediction markets are broken` | drafts | `prediction markets are broken` | Drafts on that topic |
| `https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00001` | drafts | that URL | Drafts about the linked source |
| `drafts: thread models are underrated` | drafts | `thread models are underrated` | Escape hatch: force drafts on a topic that starts with a reserved word |
| `thread` | thread | — | Auto-pick the day's highest-signal event and thread it |
| `thread oracle incentives are broken` | thread | `oracle incentives are broken` | Thread on that topic |
| `remix` | remix | — | Remix past tweets, default 180d window |
| `remix 1y` | remix | `1y` | Remix, 1-year window |
| `remix 2025-01-01:2025-03-01` | remix | `2025-01-01:2025-03-01` | Remix, explicit date range |

Then dispatch to the matching branch below. Only run the selected branch.

# Branch: DRAFTS (default / empty ${var})

Generate 10 standalone tweet drafts across 5 size tiers (2 variations each). The **argument** is the topic or URL; empty ⇒ auto-select.

Read the last **3 days** of `memory/logs/` to understand what's been covered and avoid repeating takes.

## Topic Selection (drafts)

If the argument is set, use it as the topic (it may be a keyword, a thesis, or a URL).

Otherwise, read today's `memory/logs/${today}.md` and pick the **single most tweetable insight**. Prioritize:
1. A take from today's article (already researched and opinionated)
2. A surprising connection between two of today's findings
3. A reaction to something from a tweet roundup or digest

If the topic needs fresher context, use WebSearch to verify or expand.

If `XAI_API_KEY` is set, search X for what people are already saying about the topic:
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.x.ai/v1/responses" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-4-1-fast",
    "input": [{"role": "user", "content": "Search X for what people are saying about TOPIC in the last 24 hours. Return the 5 most notable tweets with @handle and summary."}],
    "tools": [{"type": "x_search"}]
  }'
```
This helps understand the existing conversation so you can add signal, not noise. `XAI_API_KEY` is **optional** for this branch — skip the search if it's unset.

## Voice (drafts)

If soul files exist (`soul/SOUL.md`, `soul/STYLE.md`, `soul/examples/`), read them and match the owner's voice exactly.

If no soul files exist, write in a clear, direct, opinionated style:
- Short sentences. No hedging. No corporate voice.
- State the opinion first, reasoning after (if any).
- Reference specifics — names, projects, numbers — not vague hand-waving.
- No hashtags. No emojis. No "RT if you agree." No self-referential meta.

## Writing (drafts)

Generate **10 drafts** — 5 size tiers with **2 variations each**. The two variations within a tier should take genuinely different angles (different framing, emphasis, mood) — not minor rewrites.

### Size tiers

**Tier 1 — One-liner** (~50–100 chars)
Single punchy sentence. Maximum compression — every word load-bearing.

**Tier 2 — Two-punch** (~100–180 chars)
Two sentences. First sets up, second lands the hit. Claim then evidence, or observation then implication.

**Tier 3 — Paragraph** (~180–280 chars)
A full thought in one tweet. Three to four sentences. Context, position, kicker.

**Tier 4 — Long tweet** (~280–600 chars)
Uses X's extended tweet length. A mini-essay with setup, turn, and conclusion. Grounded with a specific example or data point.

**Tier 5 — Thread opener** (first tweet under 280 chars + thread sketch)
First tweet hooks — sets up a thesis. Below the tweet, include a `---` separator and a 3–5 bullet sketch of where the thread goes (key beats, not full text).

### Approach styles (mix these across variations)
- **Hot take** — opinionated position stated directly
- **Observation** — pattern-match most people aren't seeing
- **Sardonic/ironic** — dry humor
- **Reframe** — question the premise of the mainstream take
- **Data drop** — lead with a specific number or fact, then the take
- **Narrative** — tiny story or anecdote that makes the point
- **Question** — a genuine question that reframes thinking

Each tier's two variations should use **different** approach styles.

### Constraints (drafts)
- Tier 1–3: hard 280-character limit per tweet.
- Tier 4: up to 600 characters (X long tweet).
- Tier 5: first tweet under 280, thread sketch is bullet points only.
- No hashtags. No emojis. No "RT if you agree."
- No self-referential meta ("hot take:" or "unpopular opinion:").
- Count characters carefully.

## Output Format (drafts)

```
## Tweet Drafts: [topic]

### Tier 1 — One-liner
**1a. [style]**
> [tweet text]

**1b. [style]**
> [tweet text]

- [beat 2]
- [beat 3]

**5b. [style]**

```

After all 10, add a one-line pick for **best overall** and **best per tier**.

## Notify (drafts)

Send the drafts via `./notify`:
```
tweet drafts: [topic]

— one-liner —
1a. [tweet text]
1b. [tweet text]

— two-punch —
2a. [tweet text]
2b. [tweet text]

— paragraph —
3a. [tweet text]
3b. [tweet text]

— long tweet —
4a. [tweet text]
4b. [tweet text]

— thread opener —
5a. [tweet text]
5b. [tweet text]

best: #[n] — [reason]
```

Then log (see **Log**, format `drafts`).

---

# Branch: THREAD (`thread …`)

Write a tweetstorm/thread (5–10 tweets) in the operator's voice. The **argument** is the topic, thesis, or URL; empty ⇒ auto-pick the day's highest-signal event.

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` and the last **7 days** of `memory/logs/` for context. Use recent signals — notable market moves, paper picks, tweet roundup discourse — as raw material if no topic is set.

## Voice (thread)

If `soul/` files exist, read them in order before writing:
1. `soul/SOUL.md` — identity, worldview, opinions
2. `soul/STYLE.md` — writing style, sentence structure, anti-patterns
3. `soul/examples/tweets.md` — rhythm and tone calibration. Match this exactly.
4. `soul/examples/bad-outputs.md` — what NOT to do

If soul is absent, use a clear, direct, plain-spoken tone — but the anti-patterns under Writing Rules still apply.

## Topic Selection (thread)

**If the argument is set**, use it as the topic (keyword, thesis, or URL). Skip scoring and go straight to research and drafting. Pick the sharpest angle from:
- Today's `memory/logs/${today}.md` — article thesis, paper finding, market signal
- `memory/MEMORY.md` notable signals — anything with reflexivity, contradiction, or structural insight
- A connection between two recent findings that most people aren't seeing

**If the argument is empty**, auto-pick the day's highest-signal event. Every run produces something worth amplifying — a feature shipped, a price move, a milestone crossed, a notable tweet — and most of it dies unposted. Read `memory/logs/${today}.md` end-to-end, score the events that actually happened, and thread the single highest-scoring one.

### Auto-pick scoring (empty-argument mode)

Walk today's log section by section. Per section, extract at most one candidate event (first-match-wins) and score it:

| Signal | Score | Detection cue |
|---|---:|---|
| New feature / skill shipped — PR opened on a watched repo | +6 | log sections named `feature`, `external-feature`, `create-skill`, `tool-builder`; a bullet mentioning `PR:` or a PR number on a watched repo |
| Star milestone crossed (any multiple of 50 — 50, 100, 150, …) | +5 | repo-pulse `stargazers_count=N` where `N % 50 == 0`, or a star-milestone skill ran today |
| Token price move ≥ 15% (absolute, 24h) | +5 | token-report `24h` / `Price:` line in that range |
| Token price move 10–14.99% (absolute, 24h) | +3 | same line, 10–14.99% range |
| Skill built / shipped today | +4 | a `## <skill-name>` section whose body says "shipped"/"merged" or links a PR on the watched repo |
| New high-engagement tweet (≥ 20 likes OR ≥ 5 RTs) on the operator's tracked handle/token | +3 | fetch-tweets log lines with `Likes:` ≥ 20 or `RTs:` ≥ 5, filtered to the operator's configured handles/token |
| New fork by a recognizable contributor (not the agent / operator) | +2 | repo-pulse `New forks (24h):` ≥ 1, fork owner not the operator |
| Notable PR merged on a watched repo (not authored by the agent / operator) | +3 | operator-scorecard (push) log mentioning a PR whose author isn't the operator |
| New leaderboard / fork-fleet anomaly worth narrating | +2 | skill-health (analytics view) or fork-health (cohort lens) log with a non-empty anomaly section |

If one event hits multiple signals (e.g. star milestone + price move on the same day), score each separately and take the **highest single-event score** — never sum across unrelated events to clear a threshold.

Tiebreakers (highest score wins, then): newest event (latest log section) → event with a concrete URL attached (PR, tweet, article) → alphabetical by section name.

If the top candidate scores **< 3**, there's no thread worth forcing on a quiet day — note it in the log and exit without notifying or drafting. If today's log is missing or empty, do the same.

The configured handles, tracked token, and watched repos come from `soul/` and `memory/` (the operator's tracked-handle/token notes) — never hardcode them.

Good thread topics:
- A structural critique of something (oracle incentives, prediction market design, DeFi primitives)
- A thesis with data: lead with numbers, build the argument
- A contrarian take on a mainstream narrative
- A builder's breakdown of how something actually works vs. how people think it works

Avoid topics already covered in the last 48h (check logs).

If the topic needs fresh context, use WebSearch to get current data.

## Thread Structure

A thread is **5–10 tweets**. Not a listicle. Not a lecture. A narrative arc.

**Tweet 1 — Hook**
The opening hit. States the thesis or drops the most surprising fact. Must make someone stop scrolling. No setup — land in the middle of the action.

**Tweets 2–(n-1) — Development**
Each tweet is self-contained but pulls forward. Build the argument:
- Add evidence, data, or a specific example
- Introduce a complication or nuance
- Flip the framing once mid-thread
- Each tweet must earn its place — cut any that are just filler

**Tweet n — Landing**
The payoff. The implication, the action, or the reframe. Should feel like the point was building to this. Not a summary — a conclusion.

### Thread formats (pick one per run)

**Data-driven**: Lead with a striking number. Each subsequent tweet unpacks what it means.

**Structural critique**: Identify a broken mechanic. Walk through why it's broken. Show the second-order effects.

**Builder's breakdown**: How X actually works under the hood, for people who only see the surface.

**Narrative**: A sequence of events that reveals something. Ends with "here's what this tells us."

**Thesis-first**: State the position boldly in tweet 1. Spend the rest proving it.

## Writing Rules (thread)

- Write as the operator, first person.
- Match soul/STYLE.md conventions for capitalization, punctuation, and rhythm. If soul is absent: short sentences, plain language, em dashes over commas.
- State the opinion first, reasoning after.
- No hedging: kill "some might argue", "to be fair", "it remains to be seen."
- No corporate voice: kill "leverage", "ecosystem play", "exciting", "importantly."
- No filler transitions: kill "now,", "so,", "basically,", "essentially."
- Reference specific projects, people, mechanisms — not vague hand-waving.
- No hashtags. No emojis. No "RT if you agree." No "thread 🧵".
- Number tweets as 1/ 2/ 3/ etc. at the end of each tweet.
- Each tweet must pass the test: would the operator actually post this?

### Character limits (thread)
- Tweets 1 through (n-1): hard 280-character limit each.
- Final tweet: up to 280 characters.
- Count carefully. If a draft is over 280, cut it.

## Output Format (thread)

```
## Thread: [topic — 3-5 words]

**Format:** [data-driven / structural critique / builder's breakdown / narrative / thesis-first]
**Length:** [n] tweets

---

**1/**
[tweet text — 280 chars max]

**2/**
[tweet text — 280 chars max]

...

**n/**
[tweet text — 280 chars max]

---

**Why this thread:** [1-2 sentences on why this topic, why now, why the thread format (vs. single tweet)]
```

## Notify (thread)

Send via `./notify`:
```
thread: [topic — 3-5 words]

1/ [tweet 1]

2/ [tweet 2]

...

n/ [tweet n]
```

Then log (see **Log**, format `thread`). On a quiet day (top candidate < 3, or empty log), send nothing — just log the no-op.

# Branch: REMIX (`remix …`)

Fetch ~30 older tweets, pre-filter for remixability, then produce 10 new rephrased versions across diverse strategies with post-write quality gates. The **argument** overrides the time window — accepts `30d`, `180d`, `1y`, or a date range `YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD`. Defaults to `180d` (30–180 days ago window, see step 1).

<!-- autoresearch: variation B — sharper output via remixability pre-filter, strategy-rotation, skip-gate for un-remixable originals, post-write self-edit; folded in A's multi-angle queries + engagement counts and C's source-status footer + OK/EMPTY/ERROR branching -->

This branch **requires `XAI_API_KEY`**. If it's unset, emit `REMIX_TWEETS_ERROR — no XAI_API_KEY configured`, notify the cause, and stop.

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for context on current topics and recent thinking.
Scan the last **14 days** of `memory/logs/` for any `### write-tweet` entries with `**Format:** remix` (and legacy `## Remix Tweets` entries) and collect every tweet URL ever remixed — that's the persistent dedup set.

## Voice (remix)

If a `soul/` directory exists and is populated, read for voice calibration:
1. `soul/SOUL.md` — identity, worldview, opinions
2. `soul/STYLE.md` — writing style, sentence structure, anti-patterns
3. `soul/examples/tweets.md` — rhythm and tone calibration (if present)

Otherwise, match the tone of the originals fetched in step 1.

## Steps (remix)

### 1. Fetch ~30 older tweets (over-fetch for filtering)

We over-fetch so the remixability pre-filter (step 2) has room to drop un-remixable candidates without reducing the output count below 10.

**First, check the pre-fetch cache** (the workflow pre-fetches XAI results outside the sandbox):
- Read `.xai-cache/remix-tweets.json`. If it exists and contains tweet content, parse it and skip to step 2. Log `cache=hit`.

**If no cache**, resolve the time window (from the branch argument) and call the XAI API directly:

```bash
TIME_WINDOW="${ARG:-180d}"   # ARG = the remix argument parsed from ${var}; default 180d

if echo "$TIME_WINDOW" | grep -q ':'; then
  FROM_DATE=$(echo "$TIME_WINDOW" | cut -d: -f1)
  TO_DATE=$(echo "$TIME_WINDOW" | cut -d: -f2)
else
  DAYS=$(echo "$TIME_WINDOW" | sed 's/[^0-9]//g')
  UNIT=$(echo "$TIME_WINDOW" | sed 's/[0-9]//g')
  [ "$UNIT" = "y" ] && DAYS=$((DAYS * 365))
  FROM_DATE=$(date -u -d "$DAYS days ago" +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-${DAYS}d +%Y-%m-%d)
  TO_DATE=$(date -u -d "30 days ago" +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-30d +%Y-%m-%d)
fi
```

Resolve the X handle. Look up in this order: (a) `$X_HANDLE` env var, (b) handle mentioned in `soul/SOUL.md` under "Identity", (c) abort with `REMIX_TWEETS_ERROR — no handle configured`.

Run **two angled x_search queries** so the pre-filter has a diverse pool — don't rely on one query shape:

- **Query 1 — opinion posts** (most remixable): original tweets that state a take, opinion, or principle (not news-tied, not announcements).
- **Query 2 — standout posts** (high engagement = proven): top-engagement original tweets in the window.

Each query must request for every tweet: full text, date posted, engagement stats (likes, retweets, replies), and the direct `https://x.com/HANDLE/status/ID` link. Ask explicitly for **original posts only** (not replies, not retweets, not quote tweets). Aim for ~15-20 tweets per query.

```bash
# Replace HANDLE with the resolved handle
curl -s -X POST "https://api.x.ai/v1/responses" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-4-1-fast",
    "input": [{"role": "user", "content": "Search X for original tweets (exclude replies, retweets, quote tweets) posted by @HANDLE from '"$FROM_DATE"' to '"$TO_DATE"'. I want OPINION/TAKE posts — tweets that state a view, principle, or observation (not news announcements, not project updates, not single-link posts). Return up to 15. For each: full tweet text, date (YYYY-MM-DD), likes, retweets, replies, direct link https://x.com/HANDLE/status/ID. Format as numbered list."}],
    "tools": [{"type": "x_search", "allowed_x_handles": ["HANDLE"], "from_date": "'"$FROM_DATE"'", "to_date": "'"$TO_DATE"'"}]
  }'
```

Then repeat with a second body varying the prompt to "top-engagement original tweets (highest likes+retweets) in the same window. Return up to 15."

Deduplicate by tweet ID across both queries. Log `xai=ok` / `xai=partial` / `xai=fail` based on how many queries returned data.

**Sandbox fallback**: if curl fails, use WebFetch against `https://api.x.ai/v1/responses` with the same POST body (the built-in WebFetch tool bypasses the sandbox).

### 2. Remixability pre-filter (drop before remixing)

Drop any candidate that matches any of these — these rarely yield a remix worth posting:

- **Persistent dedup**: tweet URL appears anywhere in `memory/logs/*.md` under a `### write-tweet` remix entry (or legacy `## Remix Tweets`) → drop.
- **Reply/RT/quote leakage**: text starts with `@handle`, has `RT @`, or is clearly a reply/quote snippet.
- **Link-only / media-only**: text is just a URL, or <20 chars of prose around a URL.
- **News-tied / dated**: references a specific event by name, a dated product launch, or named individuals in a way that wouldn't land today (e.g., "thoughts on OpenAI's Dev Day"). Exception: if the insight is clearly evergreen and the name is incidental, keep.
- **Thread fragment**: ends with `👇`, `(1/n)`, `continued...`, or begins with a number like `2.` / `3/` — remixing a fragment strips context.
- **Meta-tweet**: "new follower milestone", "follow me for…", tweet about the account itself.
- **Non-insight humor**: jokes that depend on specific current context a reader today wouldn't have.

After filtering, you should have ≥10 candidates. If <10, fall back to **relaxing only the news-tied rule** for the least-dated candidates. If still <10, emit `REMIX_TWEETS_DEGRADED` (see step 6) and produce however many pass.

From survivors, select **exactly 10** prioritizing: (a) topical diversity (no two on the same narrow subject), (b) broader appeal (engagement as a tiebreaker, not primary filter — we care about remixability, not popularity).

### 3. Assign strategies (rotation enforced)

Before writing any remix, assign each of the 10 selected originals a **remix strategy**. The 10 assignments must span **at least 6 distinct strategies** from the list below (prevents all-sharpen laziness). No strategy may be used more than 3 times.

- **Sharpen** — wordy original compressed into a one-liner.
- **Flip the frame** — same insight from the opposite direction.
- **Update** — take still holds, ground in today's context.
- **Escalate** — mild original made spicier.
- **Soften** — hot take restated as an observation that leads the reader there.
- **Concretize** — abstract original with a specific example or data point.
- **Abstract** — specific original zoomed to the general principle.

Match strategy to original — don't force Escalate on an already-spicy take.

### 4. Write remixes

For each of the 10, draft a **new tweet** (not a paraphrase) that:
- Captures the core idea of the original.
- Uses **substantially different words and framing** (target ≥60% new vocabulary vs. the original).
- Stands alone — nothing in it should read as "this is a rewrite".
- Stays ≤280 characters.
- Matches voice (soul files or the originals' tone).

**Voice rules:**
- First person.
- Short sentences. Em dashes over commas. No semicolons.
- State the opinion first, reasoning after (if any).
- No hedging. No corporate voice. No hashtags. No emojis.

### 5. Post-write quality gate (self-edit pass)

For each remix, run this checklist. **Rewrite if any item fails.** If rewrite still fails after one attempt, **drop the tweet and replace it** with a different un-remixed survivor from step 2 (assign a fresh strategy).

1. **Specificity** — does it say something (not vague platitude)? The claim/take must be pin-pointable in one sentence.
2. **Novelty** — ≥60% of content words differ from the original. If <60%, it's a paraphrase, not a remix.
3. **Length** — ≤280 chars including spaces.
4. **No banned phrases** — remove any of: "at the end of the day", "let's be real", "hot take", "unpopular opinion", "in today's world", "as we all know", "just my two cents", "food for thought", "thread 🧵".
5. **Standalone** — reads naturally without knowing the original existed.
6. **Would-I-post-this test** — self-score 1-5. If <4, rewrite once; if rewrite is still <4, drop and replace.

Track drops in the log (step 7). If you drop more than 3, emit `REMIX_TWEETS_DEGRADED`.

### 6. Output & Notify

Lead with a one-line **batch verdict** summarizing strategy spread (e.g., "3 sharpens, 2 flips, 2 updates, 2 concretizes, 1 escalate"). Keep the whole message ≤4000 chars. No leading indentation.

Send via `./notify`:
```
*Remix Tweets — ${today}*
Batch: [one-line strategy spread]. Drops: N.

1. *[strategy]*
[original excerpt ≤80 chars] → [remix]

2. *[strategy]*
[original excerpt ≤80 chars] → [remix]

... (all 10, or fewer if DEGRADED)

source: cache=hit|miss, xai=ok|partial|fail, fetched=N, kept=N, drops=N
```

**Status branching** (prepend to the notify body as the first line instead of `Batch:`):
- `REMIX_TWEETS_OK` — 10 remixes produced, ≤3 drops.
- `REMIX_TWEETS_DEGRADED` — <10 produced OR >3 drops. Include cause.
- `REMIX_TWEETS_EMPTY` — XAI returned no usable tweets in the window. Notify once with cause and stop.
- `REMIX_TWEETS_ERROR` — no handle configured, no `XAI_API_KEY`, OR both XAI queries failed AND WebFetch fallback failed. Notify cause and stop.

### 7. Log (remix)

Append to `memory/logs/${today}.md` under the shared `### write-tweet` heading (see **Log**, format `remix`).

The URL list logged there is the canonical dedup source — every subsequent run reads these URLs back and drops any re-appearance (persistent dedup).

Save the fetched originals (even the filtered-out ones) to `memory/topics/tweet-archive.md` (append, deduplicated by URL) so other skills (article, drafts branch) can reference them as source material.

## Constraints (remix)

- Never post remixes directly — this branch only drafts. Operator reviews via notification.
- Never remix a URL already in persistent dedup.
- Never output fewer than 10 without emitting `REMIX_TWEETS_DEGRADED` with a cause.

## Environment Variables (remix)
- `XAI_API_KEY` — X.AI API key for Grok x_search. **Required** for this branch.
- `X_HANDLE` (optional) — X handle to search. Falls back to `soul/SOUL.md` Identity section if unset.

---

## Log

Append **one** entry to `memory/logs/${today}.md` under a single `### write-tweet` heading. The first bullet is always the `**Format:**` discriminator naming the branch that ran; the rest are that branch's fields.

**Format `drafts`:**
```
### write-tweet
- **Format:** drafts
- **Topic:** [topic]
- **Drafts:** 10 generated (5 tiers x 2 variations)
- **Best overall:** #[n] — [style] / [tier]

```

## Sandbox note

The sandbox may block outbound curl.
- **Drafts & remix (XAI x_search):** use **WebFetch** as a fallback for the `https://api.x.ai/v1/responses` call (the built-in WebFetch tool bypasses the sandbox). For remix, an auth pre-fetch cache is also written to `.xai-cache/remix-tweets.json` by `scripts/prefetch-*.sh` before Claude runs — read it first (step 1). For any other auth-required API, use the pre-fetch/post-process pattern (see CLAUDE.md).
- **Thread:** uses only the built-in WebSearch tool for fresh context, which bypasses the sandbox — no fallback needed.
